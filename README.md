# Chatbot - for iOS
## Chatbot app/network (Swift)

Initially Chatbot will be the basis of auto-responding bots coded in Swift, for iOS.  The bots will have some generic responses, some AI/Self Learning, and some responses based on former responses by users.  I'd like to add features that allow users to create chatbots as well.   

I am open to collaborating with others.  Get in touch if you would like to contribute.  

-The messages/responses will be saved in a database in a searchable manner, 
-Saved responses will be used as responses triggered by keywords in user messages.  
-Users will be able to create their own responses to keywords and questions.  
-Bots will have name, photo, and description (Mini Profile) so users can create who/whatever they like.
