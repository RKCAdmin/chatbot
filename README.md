# Chatbot - for iOS
## Chatbot app/network (Swift)

I'll be developing an application that allows users to communicate with and create chatbots.  The bots will have some generic responses, some AI/Self Learning, and some responses based on former responses by users. I am open to collaborating with others.  Get in touch if you would like to contribute.  

-The messages/responses will be saved in a database in a searchable manner, and will be used as responses triggered by other -keywords in user messages.  
-Users will be able to create their own responses to keywords and questions.  
-Bots will have names, and photos, so users can create who/whatever they like.
